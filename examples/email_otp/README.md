# Example: `email OTP` backend auth flow

This example shows the backend email OTP verification flow that uses the new [init_otp](https://docs.turnkey.com/api-reference/activities/init-generic-otp), [verify_otp](https://docs.turnkey.com/api-reference/activities/verify-generic-otp) and [otp_login](https://docs.turnkey.com/api-reference/activities/login-with-otp) endpoints.

**Notes:** 
- This example mocks a client-side public key generated by the user to demo the `otpLogin` returned jwt user session.
- These are all activities that should be initiated by the parent oeganization key, the specific organization id is targeted within the `otp_login` activity. For details, check out our [documentation](https://docs.turnkey.com/authentication/email#user-experience). 

### 1/ Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization and account. By following the [Quickstart](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/quickstart) guide, you should have:

- A public/private API key pair for Turnkey parent organization
- An organization ID

Once you've gathered these values, update them in the main.go scripts, you'll see placeholders like this `<parent_org_id>`.

### 2/ Running the scripts


```bash
cd go-sdk/examples/email_otp

# Run the script
go run main.go
```

The script will do the following:
- Send the OTP code to the specified email address
- Wait for you to input the OTP code
- Verify the OTP code and generate the verification token
- Verify the OTP verification token JWT signature using `crypto.VerifyOtpVerificationToken()` and the production OTP verification public key
- Login into a suborganization using the verification token, client side API key and issue the user session jwt
- Verify the session JWT signature using `crypto.VerifySessionJwtSignature()` and the production Notarizer public key
